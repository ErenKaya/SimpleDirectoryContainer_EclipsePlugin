This is an Eclipse plugin that allows creating a dynamic Classpath Container that observes a folder 
and loads all .jar (or .zip etc) files into the classpath.

It is an evolution of original code I got from here:

	https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-eclipse-classpath/

Thus it originates from Aaron Tarter (aarontar@us.ibm.com).

The primary modification I made (besides renaming things to no longer say 'example') was making it handle
filenames that had multiple dots (such as com.company.library.name.v2.jar).

The binary in the /dist/ folder just needs to be dropped into the eclipse /plugins/ folder and it will 
then allow adding a "Directory Container" library to the Java Build Path.
