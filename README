This is an Eclipse plugin that allows creating a dynamic Classpath Container that observes a folder 
and loads all .jar (or .zip etc) files into the classpath.

It is an evolution of original code I got from here:

	https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-eclipse-classpath/

Thus it originates from Aaron Tarter (aarontar@us.ibm.com).

The primary modification I made (besides renaming things to no longer say 'example') was making it handle
filenames that had multiple dots (such as com.company.library.name.v2.jar).

The binary in downloads on GitHub just needs to be dropped into the eclipse /plugins/ folder and it will 
then allow adding a "Directory Container" library to the Java Build Path.

https://github.com/downloads/benjchristensen/SimpleDirectoryContainer_EclipsePlugin/DirectoryClasspathContainer_1.0.0_EclipsePlugin.jar

I created this jar by exporting a "Deployable plug-ins and fragments" from Eclipse at the project level.

Hope it helps someone other than me.
